# WordSearchMVC5
A Asp.net MVC 5 Framework (.Net Framework) Word Search Game.

Mostly something I did to learn and had a blast doing it. 

### How to play
* Put in the amount of words that the user wants
* Type in words, the delimiter is space-separated.
* Find your words.

### TODO:
1. Send warnings when user goes over certain word count, or if user goes over grid capacity.
1. Add Unit Testing
  1. The program has not been thoroughly tested at all and I would never put this into production.
  1. Bugs are there. Lots of it, and a unit test could really help find them.
1. Improve the UI
  1. It is not a very good user experience, and is incredibly lacking.
1. Down the line I want to change the tables to grid containers.
1. Interface the generation to potentially add other word searching games.
1. Refactor
